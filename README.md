Controls:

Press 1 on your Keyboard = Randomizes a fursona

Press 2 on your Keyboard = Changes the background

You may also click on each section (top, middle, bottom) to scroll through all the different species and customize your own sona!

The goal was to make a character randomizer with a different head, body, and legs. 
And so, I thought it would have been fun to make a "Government Assigned Fursona" generator~
